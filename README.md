# the-dream - collective visualized dream journal 

summary
---
collective visualized dream journal built in angular.js and three.js, creating a frankenmonstrosity.

stuff to do
---
* pass through the dream-atoms to fetch its associated dream. I haven't read all the dreams, so if it's something weird don't blame me.
* adjust the rain size
* play the wrapper for the awesome http://voxeljs.com/ project.

controls
---
* click on the screen to lock the mouse cursor and move.
* hit esc to escape pointer-lock
* wasd - forward, back, left, right
* rf - up, down
* mouse/trackpad - look around
* left-click - forward
* right-click - backward

issues
---
* i went a little overboard on the physics with the spawning random boxes and lensflares, so it will be taxing on your gpu
* once the voxel game is initialized, it and the dream fight for pointer-lock, so just escape and re-enter pointer-lock a couple times and any issues there should be fine.

next steps
---
* terrain
* better information/animation when about to access a dream
* more call falling stuff
* adjust fog and use cubecamera for cool reflections
* backend to post new dreams to.
