In this dream, I was on the bus heading towards home.  At one stop, a long brown-haired woman got on and took the empty seat next to me.  She was gorgeous and looked a lot like someone I used to know.  After a while, I was surprised when she suddenly rested her head on my shoulder.  I looked to see if she had fallen asleep but she was wide awake.  I didn't move away or ask her to move her head because it just felt right, like it was supposed to be like that even though I didn't know this woman.  I was rudely awakened shortly after, but I always wondered what would have happened if the dream continued.
