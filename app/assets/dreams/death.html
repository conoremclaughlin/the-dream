when I was 12,and I STILL remember it to this day.I died,and when I went to 'Heaven',it was this virtual wonderland of candy,edibles and colors of all kinds,Like candy land.There was a Giant Easter Bunny(Or a man in an Easter Bunny Costume),standing and laughing.I remember him being the NICEST thing ever,and I loved him,and the place,where in my dream,I lived happily ever after.My absolute WORST dream that I can recall had to do with a boy's face burning in flames,his face was melting,and he was saying: "Help Me" quite patheticly,poor thing,and I woke up in a panicked sweat.*
