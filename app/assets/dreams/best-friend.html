The best dream I recently had was about my best friend, neither of us had sister and we know each other since we were 6 years old and call each other sisters.  I haven’t met her for the last 10 years and even though we communicate through phone and emails it’s never the same.  Well, in my dream I was arriving to Cuba and the first thing I did was to take a taxi and go to her house, minutes seemed hours to me until I finally arrived to her home, I knock at the door and she opened, the funny think in the dream is that both of us were pregnant at the time and were carrying big bellies.  We were crying for the emotion and we tried to hug each other but it was hard thing to do with such bellies, I can say we were about to give birth the babies which doesn’t makes sense since a pregnant woman at this stage can not fly but I guess dream most of the time doesn’t make sense anyway. I just keep imagining the day we can really see each other again, and with the exception of the big tummies, because either of us can have more babies, I can foresee our meeting is going to be just like my dream.
Before that I had had other dreams about visiting Cuba, in the most amazing ways: in a boat, in a surfing board, swimming, flying (actually I was able to fly as a superhero), and on and on, and trying to see her but for some reason I never get to see her before I awake.  This was the first dream we actually meet.
