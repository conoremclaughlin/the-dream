I was sitting in a movie theater, watching a film called "Made in France" or something like that I don't really recall. The main character was a girl about 25, maybe Filipino, but looked more Hawaiian than anything. She was extremely beautiful, and somehow throughout the movie she would communicate to me, as though she were actually speaking towards me in my seat. We talked about our pasts for about 30 minutes of the film, and eventually the conversation became very in depth. Nobody around me seemed to notice I was talking, or that the woman was talking to me. At the end of our conversation, she told me to find her in the real world. By then I realized I had been dreaming, and was a bit upset knowing that when I awoke it would all vanish; and it did. But, I fell back asleep, and had a few other odd dreams before coming back to this one. I found myself on the computer at home, trying to figure out who this woman was. I couldn't remember the name of the video in my dream, so I searched on Fandango (hehe). I found the film and the actresses name, and somehow also knew where she was. So I went and found her, only to see that she had a husband and two boys both around age 5. The father abused the children, and the woman was too afraid to step in. I felt I should do something, but something held me back like a sort of powerlessness I'd never experienced. Somehow my Aunt came into the dream and was lying in bed, horribly ill. She spoke to me about the couple's marriage (which I can't remember what she said now) and I awoke. I don't remember the woman's name, I wish I did. Maybe she was someone I actually knew, or someone that needed my help? Either way I'm puzzled, especially considering I'm only 15.
