I was at school and for some reason my dog was with me in HE (i know, weird..i didnt even take HE! haha), and everyone started turning into wearwolves and i had to sneak through the school to escape. I ran across the pitches at the back of the school and went in the woods where i was chased by female vampires on go-karts. I ran home and a wearwolf was slamming on my door and when it spotted me i woke up.
