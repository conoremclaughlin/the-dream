I traveled back in time to high school. There was a girl there and she asked me to a dance. Originally I was scared to go but I decided to take her up on her offer the second time around. We began talking and went for a stroll down a tree-lined sidewalk. At some point I realized I was dreaming and told her so. I told her if I went to sleep there I would wake up in my own time. Surprisingly she believed me and kissed me. We stayed together for the remainder of the day and I went home with her. We talked until I could no longer keep my eyes open and then we both rested on the bed. As soon as I put my head down next to hers I woke up.
