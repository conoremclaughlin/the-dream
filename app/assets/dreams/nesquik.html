a recurring dream ive had since i was three. i can fly by using magic socks that the nesquik bunny gave me. other nice ones that happen alot... whales EVERYWHERE. you look off the breakwall and the water is really deep and whales are swimming right next to it. i jump in and eventually drown but i drown happy. also the whales are sometimes violet or blue. i love those dreams...
