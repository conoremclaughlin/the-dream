she wasn't my biological daughter, but her father and I loved each other for a long, long time. She drowned, in awful circumstances, and it took them ages to find the body (it is a real horror story and I will not give you the details). Not long afterwards, though, I had a dream in which she came and comforted me; she was fit and healthy (which she hadn't been previously) and she led me out of the room and onto a shallow flight of stone steps that led into a huge lake, and either side the steps there were strange objects which I was inclined to ignore but she paused by each one and turned it into a living thing. I told her father, and he said that he'd had almost exactly the same dream at roughly the same time even though we're half a world away from each other.
 
I'm sure I was privileged.
